# Bank's customers analysis

The purpose of the project is to create a denormalized table with a set of indicators (features) derived from the tables available in the database, representing customers' financial behaviors and activities.

The goal is to create a feature table for training machine learning models, enriching customer data with various indicators calculated from their transactions and accounts. The final table will be linked to the customer ID and will contain both quantitative and qualitative information.
